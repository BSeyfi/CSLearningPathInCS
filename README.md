## C# Learning Path in CS Internship program

- I'm participating in a software development internship with [cs_internship program](https://github.com/cs-internship/cs-internship-spec).
- In this program, we have to pass some ***steps***. In each ***step**** we have to read some ***study items***, do some ***tasks***, and more.
- As I'm learning the **C#** field, I've to read a book and some online documentation about C#.
- I try to document what I've learned about C# in this repo.
- This documentation contains the **Important Points** and **My Experiences** while learning about C#.
- In the future, it can be used as a quick tutorial.
- This repository is gradually completed and updated over time.
> Note:
> - This repository is gradually completed and updated over time.
> - I decided to document on the Github when I reached the middle of ***step2***. So ***step1*** and the beginning part of the ***step2*** are **omitted.**
